# Some Technologies

This project was created to explore various technologies and familiarize myself with them.


## Liquibase

[Official pages](https://www.liquibase.org/get-started/how-liquibase-works)

Liquibase Community is an open source project that helps millions of developers rapidly manage database schema changes.

- **Flexible schema change**  
Supports SQL, XML, YAML and JSON formats
  
- **Auto-generate scripts**  
Automatically generate SQL scripts for reviews
 
- **Repeatable migrations**  
Perform re-runnable vs. non-re-runnable changes
  
- **Integrations and extensions**  
Works with the tools and database platforms you use
  
- **Rollbacks**  
Undo database changes, either automatically or via custom rollback SQL
  
- **Context-dependent logic**  
Use contexts and preconditions to fine-tune script execution

- **Real-time monitoring & visibility**  
Free access to Liquibase Hub for data to improve your database change process


## Protocol Buffer

[Official pages](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)

Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data
â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once,
then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety
of data streams and using a variety of languages.


## gRPC

[Official pages](https://grpc.io/)

gRPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment.
It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing,
health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices,
mobile applications and browsers to backend services.


## Feign

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign)

Feign is a Java to HTTP client binder inspired by Retrofit, JAXRS-2.0, and WebSocket.
Feign's first goal was reducing the complexity of binding Denominator uniformly to HTTP APIs regardless of ReSTfulness.

Feign works by processing annotations into a templatized request. Arguments are applied to these templates in
a straightforward fashion before output. Although Feign is limited to supporting text-based APIs, it dramatically
simplifies system aspects such as replaying requests.
Furthermore, Feign makes it easy to unit test your conversions knowing this.


## Spring Events

Spring application events allow us to throw and listen to specific application events that we can process as we wish.
Events are meant for exchanging information between loosely coupled components. As there is no direct coupling between
publishers and subscribers, it enables us to modify subscribers without affecting the publishers and vice-versa.
